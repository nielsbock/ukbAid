library(magrittr)

# After the variables have been properly selected in the `data-raw/project-variables.csv`
# file, run this function so that only the selected variables are kept in the
# `data-raw/rap-variables.csv` file. This file has the exact variable names used
# by RAP that we need in order to create the project-specific dataset. After
# running this function, review the changes in Git and add and commit the changed
# files into the history.

# Create the project dataset and save inside RAP --------------------------

# Uncomment and run the below lines **ONLY AFTER** running the above function.
# After running this code and creating the csv file in the main RAP project
# folder, comment it out again so you don't run it anymore.

# readr::read_csv(here::here("data-raw/rap-variables.csv")) %>%
#     dplyr::pull(rap_variable_name) %>%
#     ukbAid::create_csv_from_database()

# Download the project data from RAP into the session ---------------------

# Uncomment (and keep uncommented) and run after running the code above and
# letting it create your csv file of the data you want. This code below will
# download your project data and save it into the `data/data.csv` file.
# *This file should NOT be saved in the Git history.*
