project_title: Prospective study on association between legume consumption and risk
  of hepatic and biliary disease in UKB
project_description: The primary objective of this study is to examine the potential
  connection between legume consumption and the risk of various hepato-biliary disorders,
  including non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), non-alcoholic fatty liver disease
  (NAFLD), cholelithiasis, cholecystitis, cholecystectomy, pancreatitis, and pancreatectomy.
  The investigation takes into account possible factors that could influence this
  association.The study focuses on a population comprising individuals enrolled in
  the UK Biobank (UKB) who did not exhibit hepato-biliary diseases at the baseline
  assessment. Eligible participants are those who have completed one or more 24-hour
  dietary recall surveys. The intervention or exposure of interest is the daily consumption
  of legumes in grams, specifically looking at scenarios where legumes replace meat
  in the diet. In essence, the study seeks to explore whether legume consumption,
  when considered against potential confounding variables, is associated with the
  occurrence of hepato-biliary disorders, offering insights into dietary factors that
  may impact liver and gallbladder health.
