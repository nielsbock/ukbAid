## General admin

### On GitHub or own computer

Need to set a `SURVEY_ID` variable for the Google Forms Sheet ID (the
unique string that comes after the `/spreadsheets/d/` in the URL). This
needs to be set on GitHub as well as on your own computer if you are
going to download the survey data.

1.  On GitHub, add a secret in Settings called `SURVEY_ID` with the
    Google Sheet ID.
2.  On your computer, you can either add a new variable in the form of
    `SURVEY_ID=""` in a `.Renviron` file or always get asked for it
    whenever you run the functions that require the variable (which use
    the `ukbAid:::get_survey_id()` function).
