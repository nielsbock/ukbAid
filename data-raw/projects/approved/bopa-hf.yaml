project_title: Body composition, sarcopenia, physical activity, malnutrition and risk
  of heart failure
project_description: The aim of the project is to investigate the associations between
  the following domains and the incidence of heart failure. 1) Body composition based
  on DXA-derived measurements. 2) Daily physical activity based on accelerometry metrics. 3)
  Physical capacity based on DXA data, handgrip and gait speed. 4) Malnutrition based
  on weight loss, DXA data and CRP. Furthermore, the project aims at investigating the
  impact of the four domains on survival in heart failure patients.
