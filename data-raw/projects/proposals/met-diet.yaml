project_title: Dietary patterns, metabolites and cardiometabolic risk factors
project_description: 'Aim: To map out likely causal pathways using metabolites to
  link dietary patterns to changes in adiposity and metabolic health markersPopulation:
  UK Biobank will be used as a validation cohort for cross-sectional analysis conducted
  in the Fenland Study. We excluded those with diabetes at baseline.Intervention/exposure:
  Adherence to the Mediterranean diet, Alternate Healthy Eating Index and the EAT-Lancet
  diet scoreComparison: Those with low adherence to the dietary patterns.Mediators:
  249 plasma metabolites including routine lipids, lipoprotein subclass profiling
  with lipid concentrations within 14 subclasses, fatty acid composition, amino acids,
  ketone bodies and glycolysis metabolites.Outcome: BMI, waist circumference, blood
  pressure, blood lipids, blood glucose, insulin, HOMA-IR'
