## Caution when using GitHub

::: callout-note
This notice was emailed to us from UK Biobank.
:::

Use of 3rd party code-sharing repositories (e.g. GitHub)

It has come to our attention that researchers are increasingly uploading
software tools and analysis scripts - which is an acceptable practice
and required by some journals - to web-based repositories (such as
GitHub). Given that such scripts may have been run on underlying UK
Biobank data, please ensure that **no UK Biobank data are uploaded** to
these repositories (either as a result of being incorporated within the
analysis code, or otherwise being referenced in a manner that leads to
its inclusion).

Making any participant-level UK Biobank data available on a web-based
repository is not acceptable. As such, UK Biobank would re-iterate that
all researchers exercise appropriate oversight, care and control to
ensure that such uploads of data do not occur.

UK Biobank considers that the great majority of researchers are aware of
UK Biobank's requirements with regard to processing and storing of its
data, and reminds all researchers that UK Biobank participant data must
always be treated in a manner consistent with the provisions of the
Access Procedures and the MTA (and the data security provisions of the
MTA) and specifically:

-   may not be shared (directly or indirectly) with other third parties
    (outside of an approved application).
-   may not be uploaded (directly or indirectly) to web-based or other
    repositories accessible by third parties.

Aside from any legal consequences, any default in complying with these
obligations may lead to applications and registrations being terminated.

A guide to researcher best practice for use of 3rd party code sharing
repositories is available on the UK Biobank website here:

Best wishes,

UK Biobank
