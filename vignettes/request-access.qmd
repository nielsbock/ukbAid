title: "Requesting access to the UK Biobank through SDCA's project"
---

::: callout-warning
First and foremost, you must be employed by either Aarhus University or
by Region Midt and you're research topic must fall under our UK Biobank
project application.
:::

For the access to data, follow these easy steps, one by one.
Importantly, you have to wait for approval of step 1 before you can
continue with step 2. And you need to complete step 3 before moving on
the the next steps.

1.  Register yourself at [UK
    Biobank](https://www.ukbiobank.ac.uk/enable-your-research/register).
    This may take a few weeks. You **must** register under either Aarhus
    University Hospital or Aarhus University as the affiliated
    institution, as we only have project access through those, and NOT
    SDCA. If you have registered under SDCA, no worries, you can easily
    change this afterwards.

2.  Use the same details to
    [register](https://platform.dnanexus.com/register) for the UKB
    Research Analysis Platform (UKB RAP), that is hosted by DNAnexus.

3.  Log in on the UKB RAP and check that your username and email have
    been registered. You will need these details when you fill in the
    request form.

4.  Fill in this [Google Form](). This form will automatically create a
    Project Proposal in the ukbAid repository as well as creating an
    Issue that the organizing committee will ask for more details about
    before approving the project.

<!-- TODO: Add links to where proposals will be. -->

5.  Once your project has been approved and your project GitHub
    repository created for you, you can log into the
    [RAP](https://ukbiobank.dnanexus.com/login) and then follow the
    instructions on the [Using the RAP](using-rap.qmd) page.
