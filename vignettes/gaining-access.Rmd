# Proposal and registration of the project

1.  Get familiar with this Trello board. There is a lot of useful
    information.

2.  Create a card from "Project template" under How-to list and move it
    to Project proposals list. Since this card serves as a proposal to
    be reviewed by the UKBB steering committee, notify the members
    (e.g., @lwjohnst @danielibsen @danielwitte6 @christinadahm @alisa_dk
    please review proposal) via comment (Activity fields at the bottom
    of the card). The committee members will approve the access via the
    card (comment, attachments if needed, etc), so everything is
    traceable here at Trello, minimizing the need of unstructured email
    communication.

3.  Make sure your project is listed/covered by FORTEGNELSER (see card
    under Admin). If not, you need to register your project (links in
    FORTEGNELSER) and wait for this to go through before accessing the
    data. If you encounter challenges, notify (with a brief description)
    the committee members via Trello (preferably) or email.

4.  When all of this is in place, you can apply for data access, as
    described below.

# Data access

For the access to data, follow these easy steps, one by one.
Importantly, you have to wait for approval of Step 1 before you can
continue with Step 2. STEP 1: Register at UK Biobank (UKB):
https://www.ukbiobank.ac.uk/enable-your-research/register This may take
a few weeks. Note that you must register under either Aarhus University
Hospital or Aarhus University as the affiliated institution, as we only
have project access through those, and NOT SDCA. If you have registered
under SDCA, no worries, you can easily change this afterwards.

STEP 2: Use same info to register for the UKB Research Analysis Platform
(UKB RAP): https://platform.dnanexus.com/register

STEP 3: Log in on the UKB RAP (DNAnexus) platform, and check your
username and email you have registered with (same as for UKB?!). Take a
screen shot of the successful login.

# Important:

Make sure you have executed all the prior steps before proceeding with
STEP 4!

STEP 4: Send your username and e-mail (screen shot from STEP 3) you have
registered with at the UKB RAP to: Alisa.kjaergaard\@auh.rm.dk to be
added to the AUH/AU project. Remember to provide documentation for
granted access and name of your supervisor (if any).

NOTE to Alisa: Two-step process. 1. UKB AMS: edit application, add
member form a scroll down menu under AUH or AU. 2. DNAnexus:
project-\>share project (people icon to top right, add by username or
email address).

Now you can log in: https://ukbiobank.dnanexus.com/login

STEP 5: Register your project under the "Ongoing projects" list
