## Purpose and aims

We started this project for two main reason:

1.  To build up a process and workflow for effective collaboration that
    follows best practices and principles in openness, reproducibility,
    and rigor.
2.  To build a community around a shared project in order to create a
    better research culture that embraces the principles from first
    reason as well as in sharing and contributing.

In that regard, we follow the principle that anyone who participants in
the community and on sub-projects is considered a collaborator. There
are multiple opportunities for people to participate, such as through
frequent code reviews, administration around the community, providing
feedback on the project, and making edits and suggestions, among others.
