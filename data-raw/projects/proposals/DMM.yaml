project_title: Multimorbidity-Disease trajectories, risk factors and the consequence
project_description: With the growing number of people suffering from diabetes-multimorbidity1,
  and its heterogeneity in presentation and outcome, there is an urgent need to gain
  a deeper understanding of the mechanisms that determine different courses of progression
  towards diabetes-multimorbidity. The overall aim of the project is to describe the
  disease transition processes that lead to diabetes-multimorbidity and to determine
  drivers of multimorbidity trajectories. We will apply advanced epidemiological methods
  to three large populations using a multi-dimensional and multi-stage approach1,2.The
  specific aims of the project are:1. To map the heterogeneity in trajectories of
  diabetes-multimorbidity and to identify risk factors contributing to pronounced
  diabetes-multimorbidity. This will be achieved by using a machine learning approach
  for risk prediction, which involves combining a genetic algorithm with a random
  forest classifier to enhance the results;2. To understand mortality risk at different
  stages of the diabetes-multimorbidity trajectory, by comparing mortality as people
  transition from a healthy condition to single disease, and diabetes-multimorbidity
  using multi-state models;3. To develop a web application that helps clinicians visualize
  the potential impact of an intervention or achieving tighter therapeutic targets
  on the future risk of all components of diabetes-multimorbidity. This step will
  be conducted by integrating results from aims 1 and 2 using simulation approaches.Figure
