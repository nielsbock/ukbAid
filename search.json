This is also good research practice and forces one to carefully think about the study before conducting analyses.\nIn addition to the protocol, we encourage that most will also include a detailed statistical analysis plan. This also makes it easier to perform the analysis, as there is a clear direction from the beginning. The analysis plan should be of a similar detail as how you would describe your analysis in a manuscript.\nNote that as an employee at the Region or Aarhus University you have access to get your analysis plan reviewed by a statistician as part of the CONNECT initiative. If you are doing new or more complicated analyses, we encourage you to use this offer.\nThe protocol can be written in R markdown using the template provided in the ukbAid R package.

    "text": "Steps to take when outside the UKB RAP\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThis step really only needs to be done once.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nSome of these tasks can be really difficult to understand what’s going on, and that’s ok and totally normal. The very start of a project is always some of the most difficult stage of a project. But if you follow these tasks, you’ll have a solid foundation for doing your work within the special environment of the UK Biobank RAP.\n\n\nThe very first tasks you’ll need to do is to install the ukbAid package:\n\n# Install the pak package if you haven't already.\n# install.packages(\"pak\")\npak::pak(\"steno-aarhus/ukbAid\")\n\nAfter that, we need to make sure that your computer has Git configured properly. In your Console, type out the below code, replacing my name (Luke) and my email with your own:\n\nukbAid::setup_git_config(\"Luke W. Johnston\", \"lwjohnst@gmail.com\")\n\nYou should get an output showing your user.email and user.name.\nlet’s connect your project to GitHub right from the beginning. To do that in a relatively easy way, we have to create a thing called a Personal Access Token (PAT) in GitHub in order for Git on your computer to know how to connect your project to GitHub.\nIf you don’t have a GitHub account, create one first. After that (or if you already have one), when in your RStudio project, in the Console type out this command:\n\nusethis::create_github_token()\n\nThis will send you to your GitHub account and create a basic PAT for you. Change the token’s description to something like “For UKB project”. Set the “Expiry date” to 90 days (this is a good security feature). Create the token, which will change pages and you’ll be shown a string of letters starting with ghp_. Copy this token and save it somewhere safe, preferably in a password manager. This token acts a bit like your password but is safer to use than your password. Once you’ve saved it somewhere, go back to RStudio and than run this command in the Console:\n\ngitcreds::gitcreds_set()\n\nAnd then paste the token into the prompt in the Console. If it asks to replace an existing one, select the “yes” option. Doing this is a bit like using the 2FA message with the temporary passcode you get sent whenever you have to open your work’s email or when you use MitID or NemID (in Denmark). Every time you open RStudio (or start your computer), you need to run this command and give R the token so that it can connect to GitHub securely.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nWhy do we need to do this on our computer? Because whenever you connect to GitHub through RStudio (like uploading and downloading your changes), GitHub needs you to authenticate that it is you and not someone else. In order to do that, you need to give GitHub a password to do that. In the past, you could use your same password connected to your GitHub account, but the problem with this method is that your password gets sent over the Internet many times, which increases the risk that someone will maliciously obtain your password. So instead, we use a temporary, restricted-access token that we can easily create and delete. This token only has limited access to your account, so it is safer to send over the Internet, and it can be very easy to delete without affecting your account.\n\n\nNext, you will need to download (“clone” in Git language) the project repository that was created for you. In the Console, type out this, replacing my project abbreviated name (mesh) with your project abbreviated name. Note that you should use the same abbreviation as the one you used when you submitted the “Project Request” form:\n\nusethis::create_from_github(\"steno-aarhus/mesh\")\n\nFrom here, go to the Desktop or wherever you created the project and open up the RStudio .Rproj file so that the project starts up in RStudio. In this project will be the files you need to get started on the project, and especially at this stage, the doc/protocol.Rmd and the data-raw/project-variables.csv files. You’ll be working on these files before beginning to use the RAP and doing analyses.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nMost likely, you are new to Git and GitHub. Git is a very powerful way of managing your files and your projects, but it also requires some major conceptual rewiring of how you work with files and computers. It takes some time to learn! Your project is on GitHub, and you just downloaded it to your computer. Unlike Dropbox or OneDrive, the files in your project on your computer don’t automatically synchronize with those on GitHub. You have to do it manually. Whenever you use Git and save your changes to the Git history, you need to “Push” your changes to your project files to GitHub. The diagram below shows how it conceptually looks like:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe “Local” is your own computer. Whenever you “push” to GitHub, it means it will upload your file changes (like synchronizing in Dropbox). Whenever you “pull” from GitHub, it takes any changes made on GitHub and downloads them to your “Local” computer.\nWhen you work on the UKB-RAP, you will “pull” (download) your project from GitHub. As you work on it and save changes in your Git history, you “push” (upload) to GitHub often in order to keep your changes backed up. Then, when you get to the paper writing stage, you can pull your results from GitHub to your “Local” so you can work without getting charged.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nWhy do we do it this way? For one, it is honestly the easiest that we could think of because the UKB RAP is a special environment that requires special steps to work in. Plus, using Git and GitHub makes it easier to have others (like me) collaborate on your project and help you out. So hypothetically, if you need help, I (Luke) could download your project from GitHub and make changes there. Conceptually it would look like:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThat way it makes it super easy for me (or others) to help out.\n\n\nAs you work on the project, specifically the protocol and selecting the variables for your project from the data-raw/project-variables.csv list, you’ll use Git to save the changes made and push up to GitHub. Once your protocol has been reviewed and uploaded to OSF, you’re now ready to start doing the data analysis on the RAP.\nBut before doing anything else, complete the tasks in the todo.md file, which will direct you to fill in details in the README.md.\nAfter you’ve done the TODO items, start working towards writing the protocol and analysis plan before beginning your work in the UKB RAP."

What this function above does is install the necessary packages, installs the ukbAid package, sets up your Git config, sets up your authentication (credentials) to connect to GitHub, and finally downloads your GitHub repository into the RAP environment.\n\n\nOnce the project is downloaded from GitHub and created the project in the RAP, you can open it by clicking the .Rproj file inside the project folder.\nYou may have to update your credentials after opening up your project, so run this code to paste in your GitHub PAT token.\n\ngitcreds::gitcreds_set()\n\nThen, run these two lines of code in the Console while inside your RStudio Project:\n\npak::pak()\ntargets::tar_make()\n\nMore details about this step is also found in your own project’s main README.md file.\nWhen you’ve finished selecting the variables you want in the data-raw/project-variables.csv, you will need to open up the data-raw/create-data.R script and follow the instructions there to create your dataset.\n\nRemember to frequently commit and push your file changes to your GitHub.

Authorship is a strange, archaic concept that doesn’t easily fit into the modern research environment. So we instead view it as “contributorship” and leave the decision of being a “formal author” on any output to the contributors. These decisions will happen at the end of a projects lifecycle before uploading to an archive (like a preprint archive).\nProject activities: Activities like writing the paper, or coding for the analysis, or any thing else related to the project, must be done through Git and GitHub on the our steno-aarhus organization. You can have a “fork”/copy of the repository on your personal GitHub, but do your main work through the Steno account.

To examine the nature of the investigated associations, we will integrate results from different statistical methods, where each of the methods has different and largely unrelated sources of potential bias, i.e., triangulation. Besides common regression analyses, the methods will include, but not be restricted to dyadic multilevel modeling, instrumental variable approach, mediation analyses, artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning and image analyses. This will enable us to estimate the relative contribution of heritability (genetic variants as instruments for exposure) and environmental exposures (early life, adult lifestyle, parental and spousal/household exposure) on the risk of developing diabetes and associated diseases/conditions. This could potentially help identify preventable risk factors and potential drug-targets in diabetes and associated diseases."

    "text": "A3. The background and scientific rationale of the proposed research project in general\nDiabetes is a major public health burden with an estimated global prevalence of 463 million people. An estimated half of all people with diabetes are unaware of their disease and consequently will delay the onset of treatment and increase the risk of developing complications and comorbidities. These complications and comorbidities include certain types of cancers and mental health disorders (Parkinson’s disease, dementia, mood disorders), cardiovascular disease (CVD), gastro-intestinal disorders, nephropathy, neuropathy, and retinopathy. These complications also often share the same risk factors as diabetes, such as obesity, smoking, sedentary lifestyle, hypertension, and dyslipidemia, making it difficult to disentangle the relative contribution that diabetes might have on the risk for complications. For instance, people with diabetes have a higher prevalence of thyroid disorders compared with the normal population (10.8% vs. 6.6%). Diabetes and thyroid disorders have been shown to mutually influence each other: thyroid hormones contribute to the regulation of carbohydrate metabolism and pancreatic function, and diabetes affects thyroid function tests to variable extents. The presence of thyroid dysfunction may affect diabetes control, such as for the relationship between hyperthyroidism and worsening glycemic control and increased insulin requirements."

    "text": "A4. A brief description of the method(s) to be used\nIn addition to simple regression analyses in observational studies, we will employ several other statistical methods. While observational studies are prone to confounding and reverse causation, the genetic methods are largely free from both, and thus allow for inference on causality. For the genetic analysis we will use one-sample (e.g., Wald ratio) as well as two-sample Mendelian Randomization (MR) methods (inverse variance weighted, weighted median, MR-Egger, MR-PRESSO, MR Steiger), as the latter method performs well even within a single large sample such as the UK Biobank. Since the different two-sample MR methods make different assumptions about horizontal pleiotropy (when a genetic variant affects the outcome of interest through traits or pathways other than or in addition to the intermediate phenotype under investigation), we will apply them all in order to lower risk of false positive findings and bias.\nTo examine the pathways through which an exposure affects an outcome, we will employ mediation analyses: multivariable MR (MVMR) and the NetCoupler-algorithm. MVMR allows for equivalent analysis to mediation within the MR framework, and can therefore estimate mediation effects. NetCoupler is an algorithm that estimates causal pathways between a set of -omic (e.g., metabolomics, lipidomics) or other high-dimensional metabolic data and either a disease outcome, an exposure, or both.\nDyadic multilevel analysis will be used to identify hour-by-hour patterns of covariation in daily physical activity and sleep between couples over a seven day time window. Image analyses based on different established as well as novel modalities will be used to investigate the associations between metabolic phenotypes and diabetes with cardiovascular and cerebral/cognitive complications, i.e. target organ damage (e.g., cardiac function, vascular integrity, carotid remodeling, structural cerebral change) and clinical complications (cardiovascular event, cognitive function)."

The expected value of the research\nWe expect to be able to estimate the relative contribution of heritability (genetic variants as instruments for exposure) and environmental exposures (early life, adult lifestyle and parental and spousal/household exposure) on the risk of developing diabetes and associated diseases/conditions. Identifying potentially preventable risk factors and potential drug-targets in diabetes and associated diseases/conditions has the potential to improve prevention and treatment of these diseases/conditions."

People with diabetes are at a higher risk for getting other health complications like cardiovascular disease, kidney and thyroid diseases, cancer, and mental health disorders. These complications also often share the same risk factors as diabetes, such as obesity, smoking, sedentary lifestyle, hypertension, and dyslipidemia. We want to understand how diabetes contributes to these complications/conditions (and vice versa) so that we can use that information in trying to find potential treatments with drugs or other interventions. For instance, if diabetes impacts a certain disease because of genes, this might be a good place to consider how drugs might help. Or if we find that a specific lifestyle behaviour or feature in the environment, an intervention might be a better approach to use. The project is going to last at least three years."
