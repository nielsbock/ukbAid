title: "Requesting access to the UK Biobank through SDCA's project"
---

::: callout-warning
First and foremost, you must be employed by either Aarhus University or
by Region Midt and your research topic must fall under our UK Biobank
project application.
:::

To access the data, follow these easy steps, one by one. Importantly,
you have to wait for approval of step 1 before you can continue with
step 2. And you need to complete step 3 before moving on the next steps.

1.  Register yourself at [UK Biobank](https://ams.ukbiobank.ac.uk/ams/).
    This may take a few weeks. You **must** register under either Aarhus
    University Hospital or Aarhus University as the affiliated
    institution, as we only have project access through those, and NOT
    SDCA. If you have registered under SDCA, no worries, you can easily
    change this afterwards.

2.  Use the same details as above to
    [register](https://platform.dnanexus.com/register) for the UKB
    Research Analysis Platform (UKB RAP), which is hosted by DNAnexus.

3.  Log in on the UKB RAP and check that your username and email have
    been registered. You will need these details when you fill in the
    request form.

4.  Create a [GitHub](https://github.com/join) account if you don't have
    one already. You will need your user name when filling in the Form
    below.

5.  Fill in a [Google
    Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdiY5j0JigvNTp5onPRPwV3paXudxeV00GUHnLTRxii9FWW1Q/viewform?usp=sf_link)
    (also provided below). All the details you include in this form
    **will** be uploaded online to the ukbAid repository. When you
    submit the form, it will automatically create a Pull Request of your
    Project Proposal on the ukbAid GitHub repository as well as creating
    an Issue that the organizing committee will use to get more
    information or details before approving the project.

6.  Once your project has been approved, we will create a project
    repository for you on GitHub that will also contain an Issue with a
    list of todo items. After that follow the instructions in the
    [Initial setup](initial-setup.qmd) page, as well as the [Using the
    RAP](using-rap.qmd) page. After that you can log into the
    [RAP](https://ukbiobank.dnanexus.com/login) and familiarize yourself
    with the RAP.
